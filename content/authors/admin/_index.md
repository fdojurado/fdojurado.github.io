I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science ([DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english)) within the [Embedded Systems Engineering (ESE) section](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/ese) of the [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.dtu.dk/english/). I received the Ph.D. degree in Engineering and the M.Eng. degree in Telecommunications Engineering both from [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), Australia, in 2020 and 2015, respectively; a B.Eng. degree in Electronics Engineering in 2012 from the [Universidad del Valle](https://www.univalle.edu.co/), Colombia.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSNs) and Machine Learning (ML). I use this synergy research effort to cope with the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications and solve the technological barrier of resource management and reconfiguration complexities currently found in IoT applications. Overall, I am interested in  networked embedded systems, SDWSNs, ML, protocols and applications for the IoT.
