abstract: The software defined networking framework facilitates flexible and reliable internet of things networks by moving the network intelligence to a centralized location while enabling low power wireless network in the edge. In this paper, we present SD-WSN6Lo, a novel software-defined wireless management solution for 6LoWPAN networks that aims to reduce the management complexity in WSN's. As an example of the technique, a simulation of controlling the power consumption of sensor nodes is presented. The results demonstrate improved energy consumption of approximately 15% on average per node compared to the baseline condition.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
