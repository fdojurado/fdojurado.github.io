I use this synergy research effort to cope with the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications and solve the technological barrier of resource management and reconfiguration complexities currently found in IoT applications. Overall, I am interested in networked embedded systems, SDWSNs, ML, protocols and applications for the IoT.\n","date":1685491200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1685491200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (DTU Compute) within the Embedded Systems Engineering (ESE) section of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
