This is an effort to optimize the energy consumption of WSNs that provide services to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). A centralized controller grants a global view of the sensor network by introducing extra control overhead in the network, but this leads to extra energy costs. However, our new algorithm takes advantage of this global view and balances the network energy by selecting paths with the highest remaining energy level among multiple paths for each sensor node. We also identify key functions draining energy from the SDWSN and minimize their impact by implementing a data packet aggregation function, and minimizing the control overhead by keeping track of the sensor nodes' routing tables using a simple checksum function. We show that the proposed approach prolongs the network lifetime of the WSN by 6.5% on average compared to the standard shortest-path algorithm, and that the control overhead is reduced by approximately 12% while still maintaining a very high packet delivery ratio.","tags":["Centralized routing","Industrial Internet of Things","Network Lifetime","Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks","Software-Defined Routing","Wireless Sensor Networks"],"title":"Energy-Aware Routing for Software-Defined Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The proposed model consists of breaking down all key functions involved in the correct functioning of an SD-WSN, namely; neighbor discovery, neighbor advertisement, network configuration, and data collection. The model is analyzed from a multihop network perspective. We consider two static SD-WSN scenarios to examine scalability, and one scenario to assess the performance implications in a pseudo-dynamic SD-WSN. Extensive simulation results are presented regarding the control overhead introduced, the percentage of alive nodes and remaining energy, and the impacts on network lifetime. We show that the accumulated control overhead is inversely proportional to the interaction period with the controller, whereas the remaining energy and the network lifetime are directly proportional to this parameter. Results show that the control overhead, for static SD-WSNs, can take up to 10%-29% of the total data flowing to the controller for the large SD-WSN and 6-19% for the small SD-WSN. For a pseudo-dynamic network, the control overhead can take up to two-thirds of the total data sent to the controller, and the network lifetime was reduced by up to 80% compared with the static scenarios.","tags":["Control overhead","Energy Consumption","Internet of Things","Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks","Wireless Sensor Networks"],"title":"Performance Analysis of Software-Defined Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

Previous studies have often been limited to software simulations or general proposals only. In this article, we design and evaluate an SDN-based management system for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN). The framework is described in detail covering different data-, control-, and application-plane implementations, and includes a novel addressing scheme and packet format. It also uses a centralized routing protocol, located at the SDN controller, based on the shortest path algorithm. We compare our approach with the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL), which uses a distributed routing protocol. Hardware tests were carried out in a dynamic environment, with multiple sources of interference for different payload sizes to evaluate the impacts and practicality of SDN in WSNs. The performance comparison shows that the proposed SDN management system for IP-enabled WSNs using a centralized routing protocol outperforms the RPL protocol in terms of round-trip time, jitter, memory consumption, and packet loss rate (PLR), despite the control overhead introduced.","tags":["Internet of Things","Software-Defined Networks","Task Management","Topology Management","Wireless Sensor Networks","WSN management"],"title":"A Software-Defined Management System for IP-Enabled WSNs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
