I use this synergy research effort to cope with the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications and solve the technological barrier of resource management and reconfiguration complexities currently found in IoT applications. Overall, I am interested in networked embedded systems, software-defined wireless sensor networks, machine learning, protocols and applications for the Internet of Things.\n Download my resumé. -- ","date":1613433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1613433600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://fdojurado.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I received the Ph.D. degree in Engineering and the M.Eng. degree in Telecommunications Engineering both from The University of Melbourne, Australia, in 2020 and 2015, respectively; a B.Eng. degree in Electronics Engineering in 2012 from the Universidad del Valle, Colombia.","tags":null,"title":"F.
