    "text": "About Me\n    \n    \n    I am an experienced Engineer specializing in IoT, Networked Embedded Systems, and Machine Learning for communications and networking. With a background as a postdoctoral researcher at DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark, I have acquired a Ph.D. in Engineering from The University of Melbourne, focusing on Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSNs). Additionally, I hold an M.Eng. in Telecommunications Engineering from The University of Melbourne and a B.Eng. in Electronics Engineering from Universidad del Valle, Colombia.\n    \n    I am passionate about addressing challenges in IoT ecosystems, particularly in resource management, network optimization, and intelligent runtime adaptation. My research interests revolve around the intersection of IoT, embedded systems, and ML, where I strive to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.\n    In addition to my research contributions, I have been actively involved in teaching and mentoring activities. Serving as a Head Tutor and Guest Lecturer for various courses, I have provided comprehensive guidance and fostered a collaborative learning environment for students. I have also supervised several undergraduate and postgraduate students in their research projects, guiding them through the research process and helping them develop their technical skills."
