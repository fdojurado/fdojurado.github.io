HRL-TSCH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning-based TSCH Scheduler for IIoT. arXiv. [*rxiv]\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) demands adaptable Networked Embedded Systems (NES) for optimal performance. Combined with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), tailored solutions can be developed to meet specific application requirements. This study introduces HRL-TSCH, an approach rooted in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), to devise Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) schedules provisioning IIoT demand. HRL-TSCH employs dual policies: one at a higher level for TSCH schedule link management, and another at a lower level for timeslot and channel assignments. The proposed RL agents address a multi-objective problem, optimizing throughput, power efficiency, and network delay based on predefined application requirements. Simulation experiments demonstrate HRL-TSCH superiority over existing state-of-art approaches, effectively achieving an optimal balance between throughput, power consumption, and delay, thereby enhancing IIoT network performance.\n\n\nKeywords: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Networked Embedded Systems (NES); Sleep Scheduling; Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH); Reinforcement Learning (RL); Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSNs)\n\n\nJurado-Lasso, F.

[*rxiv] [code] [slides] [doc]\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is shaping the next generation of cyber-physical systems to improve the future industry for smart cities. It has created novel and essential applications that require specific network performance to enhance the quality of services. Since network performance requirements are application-oriented, it is of paramount importance to provide tailored solutions that seamlessly manage the network resources and orchestrate the network to satisfy user requirements. In this article, we propose ELISE, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to optimize the slotframe size of the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) protocol in IIoT networks while considering the user requirements. We primarily address the problem of designing a framework that self-adapts to the optimal slotframe length that best suits the user’s requirements. The framework takes care of all functionalities involved in the correct functioning of the network, while the RL agent instructs the framework with a set of actions to determine the optimal slotframe size each time the user requirements change. We evaluate the performance of ELISE through extensive analysis based on simulations and experimental evaluations on a testbed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in adapting network resources at runtime to satisfy user requirements.\n\n\nKeywords: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs); Network Management; Reinforcement Learning (RL); Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH)\n\n\nJournal Articles (4)\nJurado-Lasso, F.

IEEE Access, vol. 10, pp. 23560-23592. [pdf] [*rxiv]\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWireless Sensor Network (WSN), which are enablers of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, are typically used en-masse in widely physically distributed applications to monitor the dynamic conditions of the environment. They collect raw sensor data that is processed centralised. With the current traditional techniques of state-of-art WSN programmed for specific tasks, it is hard to react to any dynamic change in the conditions of the environment beyond the scope of the intended task. To solve this problem, a synergy between Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and WSN has been proposed. This paper aims to present the current status of Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Network (SDWSN) proposals and introduce the readers to the emerging research topic that combines Machine Learning (ML) and SDWSN concepts, also called ML-SDWSNs. ML-SDWSN grants an intelligent, centralised and resource-aware architecture to achieve improved network performance and solve the challenges currently found in the practical implementation of SDWSNs. This survey provides helpful information and insights to the scientific and industrial communities, and professional organisations interested in SDWSN, mainly the current state-of-art, ML techniques, and open issues\n\n\nKeywords: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs); Internet of Things (IoT); Machine Learning (ML); software-defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSNs); Machine Learning Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (ML-SDWSNs)\n\n\nJurado-Lasso, F.

[pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn this paper, we propose an energy-aware routing algorithm and a control overhead reduction technique for prolonging the network lifetime of software-defined multihop wireless sensor networks (SDWSNs). This is an effort to optimize the energy consumption of WSNs that provide services to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). A centralized controller grants a global view of the sensor network by introducing extra control overhead in the network, but this leads to extra energy costs. However, our new algorithm takes advantage of this global view and balances the network energy by selecting paths with the highest remaining energy level among multiple paths for each sensor node. We also identify key functions draining energy from the SDWSN and minimize their impact by implementing a data packet aggregation function, and minimizing the control overhead by keeping track of the sensor nodes’ routing tables using a simple checksum function. We show that the proposed approach prolongs the network lifetime of the WSN by 6.5% on average compared to the standard shortest-path algorithm, and that the control overhead is reduced by approximately 12% while still maintaining a very high packet delivery ratio.\n\n\nKeywords: Centralized routing; Industrial Internet of Things; network lifetime; software defined wireless sensor networks, software-defined routing, wireless sensor networks.\n\n\nJurado-Lasso, F.

[pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn this article, we propose a model-based characterization of energy consumption in a software-defined wireless sensor network (SD-WSN) architecture in an effort to examine the implications for network performance when making the WSN reprogrammable. The proposed model consists of breaking down all key functions involved in the correct functioning of an SD-WSN, namely; neighbor discovery, neighbor advertisement, network configuration, and data collection. The model is analyzed from a multihop network perspective. We consider two static SD-WSN scenarios to examine scalability, and one scenario to assess the performance implications in a pseudo-dynamic SD-WSN. Extensive simulation results are presented regarding the control overhead introduced, the percentage of alive nodes and remaining energy, and the impacts on network lifetime. We show that the accumulated control overhead is inversely proportional to the interaction period with the controller, whereas the remaining energy and the network lifetime are directly proportional to this parameter. Results show that the control overhead, for static SD-WSNs, can take up to 10%-29% of the total data flowing to the controller for the large SD-WSN and 6-19% for the small SD-WSN. For a pseudo-dynamic network, the control overhead can take up to two-thirds of the total data sent to the controller, and the network lifetime was reduced by up to 80% compared with the static scenarios.\n\n\nKeywords: Control overhead; energy consumption; Internet of Things (IoT); software-defined wireless sensor networks (SD-WSNs); wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\n\n\nJurado-Lasso, F.

[pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nSoftware-defined networking (SDN) offers potential pathways to overcome the management complexity of the Internet of Things (IoT). Previous studies have often been limited to software simulations or general proposals only. In this article, we design and evaluate an SDN-based management system for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN). The framework is described in detail covering different data-, control-, and application-plane implementations, and includes a novel addressing scheme and packet format. It also uses a centralized routing protocol, located at the SDN controller, based on the shortest path algorithm. We compare our approach with the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL), which uses a distributed routing protocol. Hardware tests were carried out in a dynamic environment, with multiple sources of interference for different payload sizes to evaluate the impacts and practicality of SDN in WSNs. The performance comparison shows that the proposed SDN management system for IP-enabled WSNs using a centralized routing protocol outperforms the RPL protocol in terms of round-trip time, jitter, memory consumption, and packet loss rate (PLR), despite the control overhead introduced.\n\n\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); software-defined networks; task management; topology management; wireless sensor networks (WSNs); WSN management\n\n\nConference Papers (1)\nJurado-Lasso, F.
