However, traditional stationary gateways (GWs) impose scalability and cost constraints. We propose an AI-driven mobile GW architecture that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adapt GW mobility based on real-time network conditions. Our custom mobility module, integrated into OMNeT++ with FLoRa and TensorFlow Lite Micro, enables on-the-fly decision-making to optimize Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and fairness. The results of the simulations show that the introduced RL-GW achieves up to 99.94% PDR in high-fidelity simulations, outperforming static and heuristic mobile strategies. The RL policy generalizes robustly across network sizes and scenarios, offering a scalable, low-overhead solution for adaptive LPWAN infrastructure.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @inproceedings{mobility-lorawan-2025, author = {Valentin, August Falck and Janum, Simon Kristoffer and Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Fafoutis, Xenofon and Orfanidis, Charalampos}, title = {Adaptive Mobility Control in LoRaWAN via Reinforcement Learning}, year = {2025}, booktitle = {2025 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications}, organization = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/WiMob66857.2025.11257535}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Copyright\n                © 2025 IEEE.

The proposed model consists of breaking down all key functions involved in the correct functioning of an SD-WSN, namely; neighbor discovery, neighbor advertisement, network configuration, and data collection. The model is analyzed from a multihop network perspective. We consider two static SD-WSN scenarios to examine scalability, and one scenario to assess the performance implications in a pseudo-dynamic SD-WSN. Extensive simulation results are presented regarding the control overhead introduced, the percentage of alive nodes and remaining energy, and the impacts on network lifetime. We show that the accumulated control overhead is inversely proportional to the interaction period with the controller, whereas the remaining energy and the network lifetime are directly proportional to this parameter. Results show that the control overhead, for static SD-WSNs, can take up to 10%-29% of the total data flowing to the controller for the large SD-WSN and 6-19% for the small SD-WSN. For a pseudo-dynamic network, the control overhead can take up to two-thirds of the total data sent to the controller, and the network lifetime was reduced by up to 80% compared with the static scenarios.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @article{performance-analysis-sdwsn-2020, author = {Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Clarke, Ken and Nirmalathas, Ampalavanapillai}, title = {Performance analysis of software-defined multihop wireless sensor networks}, year = {2020}, journal = {IEEE Systems Journal}, volume = {14}, number = {4}, pages = {4653–4662}, publisher = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/JSYST.2019.2948203}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Copyright\n                © 2020 IEEE.

Operating in remote and resourceconstrained environments, these IoT devices face challenges related to energy consumption, crucial for network longevity. Existing clustering protocols often suffer from high control overhead, inefficient cluster formation, and poor adaptability to dynamic network conditions, leading to suboptimal data transmission and reduced network lifetime. This paper introduces Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy with Reinforcement Learning-based Controller (LEACH-RLC), a novel clustering protocol designed to address these limitations by employing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach for strategic selection of Cluster Heads (CHs) and node-to-cluster assignments. Additionally, it integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to minimize control overhead by learning optimal timings for generating new clusters. LEACH-RLC aims to balance control overhead reduction without compromising overall network performance. Through extensive simulations, this paper investigates the frequency and opportune moments for generating new clustering solutions. Results demonstrate the superior performance of LEACH-RLC over state-of-theart protocols, showcasing enhanced network lifetime, reduced average energy consumption, and minimized control overhead.

They collect raw sensor data that is processed centralised. With the current traditional techniques of state-of-art WSN programmed for specific tasks, it is hard to react to any dynamic change in the conditions of the environment beyond the scope of the intended task. To solve this problem, a synergy between Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and WSN has been proposed. This paper aims to present the current status of Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Network (SDWSN) proposals and introduce the readers to the emerging research topic that combines Machine Learning (ML) and SDWSN concepts, also called ML-SDWSNs. ML-SDWSN grants an intelligent, centralised and resource-aware architecture to achieve improved network performance and solve the challenges currently found in the practical implementation of SDWSNs. This survey provides helpful information and insights to the scientific and industrial communities, and professional organisations interested in SDWSN, mainly the current state-of-art, ML techniques, and open issues.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @article{survey-ml-sdwsn-2022, author = {Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Marchegiani, Letizia and Jurado, Jesus Fabian and Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M. and Fafoutis, Xenofon}, title = {A survey on machine learning software-defined wireless sensor networks (ML-SDWSNS): Current status and major challenges}, year = {2022}, journal = {IEEE Access}, volume = {10}, pages = {23560–23592}, publisher = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3153521}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                License\n                CC BY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            Metrics\n            \n                \n                    PlumX Metrics\n                    \n                        \n                            A survey on machine learning software-defined wireless sensor networks (ML-SDWSNS): Current status and major challenges\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    Altmetrics"

Combined with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), tailored solutions can be developed to meet specific application requirements. This study introduces HRL-TSCH, an approach rooted in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), to devise Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) schedules provisioning IIoT demand. HRL-TSCH employs dual policies: one at a higher level for TSCH schedule link management, and another at a lower level for timeslot and channel assignments. The proposed RL agents address a multi-objective problem, optimizing throughput, power efficiency, and network delay based on predefined application requirements. Simulation experiments demonstrate HRL-TSCH superiority over existing state-of-art approaches, effectively achieving an optimal balance between throughput, power consumption, and delay, thereby enhancing IIoT network performance.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @article{hrl-tsch-2024, author = {Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Orfanidis, Charalampos and Jurado, Jesus Fabian and Fafoutis, Xenofon}, title = {HRL-TSCH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning-based TSCH Scheduler for IIoT}, year = {2024}, journal = {IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking}, volume = {10}, number = {6}, pages = {2102–2118}, publisher = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/TCCN.2024.3408459}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                License\n                CC BY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            Metrics\n            \n                \n                    PlumX Metrics\n                    \n                        \n                            HRL-TSCH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning-based TSCH Scheduler for IIoT\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    Altmetrics"

It has created novel and essential applications that require specific network performance to enhance the quality of services. Since network performance requirements are application-oriented, it is of paramount importance to provide tailored solutions that seamlessly manage the network resources and orchestrate the network to satisfy user requirements. In this article, we propose ELISE, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize the slotframe size of the time slotted channel hopping protocol in IIoT networks while considering the user requirements. We primarily address the problem of designing a framework that self-adapts to the optimal slotframe length that best suits the user’s requirements. The framework takes care of all functionalities involved in the correct functioning of the network, while the RL agent instructs the framework with a set of actions to determine the optimal slotframe size each time the user requirements change. We evaluate the performance of ELISE through extensive analysis based on simulations and experimental evaluations on a testbed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in adapting network resources at runtime to satisfy user requirements.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @article{elise-tsch-2024, author = {Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Barzegaran, Mohammadreza and Jurado, Jesus Fabian and Fafoutis, Xenofon}, title = {ELISE: A Reinforcement Learning Framework to Optimize the Slotframe Size of the TSCH Protocol in IoT Networks}, year = {2024}, journal = {IEEE Systems Journal}, volume = {18}, number = {2}, pages = {1068–1079}, publisher = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/JSYST.2024.3371429}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                License\n                CC BY\n            \n        \n\n        \n            Metrics\n            \n                \n                    PlumX Metrics\n                    \n                        \n                            ELISE: A Reinforcement Learning Framework to Optimize the Slotframe Size of the TSCH Protocol in IoT Networks\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    Altmetrics"

Previous studies have often been limited to software simulations or general proposals only. In this article, we design and evaluate an SDN-based management system for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN). The framework is described in detail covering different data-, control-, and application-plane implementations, and includes a novel addressing scheme and packet format. It also uses a centralized routing protocol, located at the SDN controller, based on the shortest path algorithm. We compare our approach with the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL), which uses a distributed routing protocol. Hardware tests were carried out in a dynamic environment, with multiple sources of interference for different payload sizes to evaluate the impacts and practicality of SDN in WSNs. The performance comparison shows that the proposed SDN management system for IP-enabled WSNs using a centralized routing protocol outperforms the RPL protocol in terms of round-trip time, jitter, memory consumption, and packet loss rate (PLR), despite the control overhead introduced.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @article{management-sdwsn-2020, author = {Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Clarke, Ken and Nirmalathas, Ampalavanapillai}, title = {A software-defined management system for IP-enabled WSNs}, year = {2020}, journal = {IEEE Systems Journal}, volume = {14}, number = {2}, pages = {2335–2346}, publisher = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/JSYST.2019.2946781}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Copyright\n                © 2020 IEEE.

This is an effort to optimize the energy consumption of WSNs that provide services to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). A centralized controller grants a global view of the sensor network by introducing extra control overhead in the network, but this leads to extra energy costs. However, our new algorithm takes advantage of this global view and balances the network energy by selecting paths with the highest remaining energy level among multiple paths for each sensor node. We also identify key functions draining energy from the SDWSN and minimize their impact by implementing a data packet aggregation function, and minimizing the control overhead by keeping track of the sensor nodes’ routing tables using a simple checksum function. We show that the proposed approach prolongs the network lifetime of the WSN by 6.5% on average compared to the standard shortest-path algorithm, and that the control overhead is reduced by approximately 12% while still maintaining a very high packet delivery ratio.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @article{energy-aware-routing-2021, author = {Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Clarke, Ken and Nirmalathas, Ampalavanapillai}, title = {Energy-aware routing for software-defined multihop wireless sensor networks}, year = {2021}, journal = {IEEE Sensors Journal}, volume = {21}, number = {8}, pages = {10174–10182}, publisher = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/JSEN.2021.3059789}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Copyright\n                © 2021 IEEE.

In this paper, we present SD-WSN6Lo, a novel software-defined wireless management solution for 6LoWPAN networks that aims to reduce the management complexity in WSN’s. As an example of the technique, a simulation of controlling the power consumption of sensor nodes is presented. The results demonstrate improved energy consumption of approximately 15% on average per node compared to the baseline condition.\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n                BibTeX citation\n            \n        \n        \n                                @inproceedings{dsn-iot-6lowpan-2018, author = {Jurado-Lasso, F Fernando and Clarke, Ken and Nirmalathas, Ampalavanapillai}, title = {A software-defined networking framework for IoT based on 6LoWPAN}, year = {2018}, booktitle = {2018 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium (WTS)}, organization = {IEEE}, doi = {10.1109/WTS.2018.8363938}}\n                    \n                \n        \n\n        \n            \n                Copyright\n                © 2018 IEEE.
