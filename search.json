The proposed\n    model consists of breaking down all key functions involved in the\n    correct functioning of an SD-WSN, namely; neighbor discovery,\n    neighbor advertisement, network configuration, and data collection.\n    The model is analyzed from a multihop network perspective. We\n    consider two static SD-WSN scenarios to examine scalability, and one\n    scenario to assess the performance implications in a pseudo-dynamic\n    SD-WSN. Extensive simulation results are presented regarding the\n    control overhead introduced, the percentage of alive nodes and\n    remaining energy, and the impacts on network lifetime. We show that\n    the accumulated control overhead is inversely proportional to the\n    interaction period with the controller, whereas the remaining energy\n    and the network lifetime are directly proportional to this\n    parameter. Results show that the control overhead, for static\n    SD-WSNs, can take up to 10\\%-29\\% of the total data flowing to the\n    controller for the large SD-WSN and 6-19\\% for the small SD-WSN. For\n    a pseudo-dynamic network, the control overhead can take up to\n    two-thirds of the total data sent to the controller, and the network\n    lifetime was reduced by up to 80\\% compared with the static\n    scenarios.}\n}"

This is an effort to optimize the energy\n    consumption of WSNs that provide services to the Industrial Internet\n    of Things (IIoT). A centralized controller grants a global view of\n    the sensor network by introducing extra control overhead in the\n    network, but this leads to extra energy costs. However, our new\n    algorithm takes advantage of this global view and balances the\n    network energy by selecting paths with the highest remaining energy\n    level among multiple paths for each sensor node. We also identify\n    key functions draining energy from the SDWSN and minimize their\n    impact by implementing a data packet aggregation function, and\n    minimizing the control overhead by keeping track of the sensor\n    nodes’ routing tables using a simple checksum function. We show that\n    the proposed approach prolongs the network lifetime of the WSN by\n    6.5\\% on average compared to the standard shortest-path algorithm,\n    and that the control overhead is reduced by approximately 12\\% while\n    still maintaining a very high packet delivery ratio.}\n}"

This paper introduces Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering\n    Hierarchy with Reinforcement Learning-based Controller (LEACH-RLC),\n    a novel clustering protocol that employs a Mixed Integer Linear\n    Programming (MILP) for strategic selection of cluster heads (CHs)\n    and node-to-cluster assignments.

Through\n    extensive simulations, this paper investigates the frequency and\n    opportune moments for generating new clustering solutions.

Previous studies have often been limited to software\n    simulations or general proposals only. In this article, we design\n    and evaluate an SDN-based management system for wireless sensor\n    networks (WSNs) using IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area\n    networks (6LoWPAN). The framework is described in detail covering\n    different data-, control-, and application-plane implementations,\n    and includes a novel addressing scheme and packet format. It also\n    uses a centralized routing protocol, located at the SDN controller,\n    based on the shortest path algorithm. We compare our approach with\n    the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL), which\n    uses a distributed routing protocol. Hardware tests were carried out\n    in a dynamic environment, with multiple sources of interference for\n    different payload sizes to evaluate the impacts and practicality of\n    SDN in WSNs. The performance comparison shows that the proposed SDN\n    management system for IP-enabled WSNs using a centralized routing\n    protocol outperforms the RPL protocol in terms of round-trip time,\n    jitter, memory consumption, and packet loss rate (PLR), despite the\n    control overhead introduced.}\n}"

It has created novel and essential applications that require\n    specific network performance to enhance the quality of services.\n    Since network performance requirements are application-oriented, it\n    is of paramount importance to provide tailored solutions that\n    seamlessly manage the network resources and orchestrate the network\n    to satisfy user requirements. In this article, we propose ELISE, a\n    reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize the slotframe size\n    of the time slotted channel hopping protocol in IIoT networks while\n    considering the user requirements. We primarily address the problem\n    of designing a framework that self-adapts to the optimal slotframe\n    length that best suits the user’s requirements. The framework takes\n    care of all functionalities involved in the correct functioning of\n    the network, while the RL agent instructs the framework with a set\n    of actions to determine the optimal slotframe size each time the\n    user requirements change. We evaluate the performance of ELISE\n    through extensive analysis based on simulations and experimental\n    evaluations on a testbed to demonstrate the efficiency of the\n    proposed approach in adapting network resources at runtime to\n    satisfy user requirements.}\n}"
