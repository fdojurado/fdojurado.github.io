    "text": "Research interests\n        I am passionate about exploring the dynamic realm where Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSNs) intersect with the power of Machine Learning (ML). This unique fusion of technologies serves as the focal point of my research endeavors. My goal is to address the burgeoning challenges posed by the ever-increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications. My research is dedicated to overcoming the technological barriers associated with resource management and reconfiguration complexities prevalent in current IoT applications. Delving into the intricacies of networked embedded systems, SDWSNs, ML, and IoT protocols and applications.\n        Beyond this, my curiosity extends to the application of ML/AI for communications and networking. I am enthusiastic about harnessing the potential of these cutting-edge technologies to enhance the efficiency and intelligence of communication systems.\n        My research output consists of 8 publications in 6 different sources, including 6 Journal Article, 1 Preprint, 1 Conference Paper. I am first author in 8 of them."
